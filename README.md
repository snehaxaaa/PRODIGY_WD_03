<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves implementing a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of Task No. 3 at Prodigy Infotech.
<br>
<h2>Task Details</h2><br>
<b>Internship:</b> Prodigy Infotech<br>
    <b>Task Number: </b>3
<br>        <b>Task Description:</b>To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other or against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game
<h2>Features</h2>
<b>Responsive design:</b> The game interface adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.<br>
<b>Win detection: </b> The game automatically detects and highlights the winning combination.<br>
<b>Restart option:</b> Players can restart the game at any point to play again.<br>


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<b>HTML<br>
CSS<br>
  
JavaScript</b>

<h2>Usage</h2>
The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O').<br>
Player 1 starts the game with 'X', followed by Player 2 with 'O'.<br>
To place a mark, click on an empty cell in the grid.<br>
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.<br>
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.<br>
